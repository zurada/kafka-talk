Talk on: How do we use Apache Kafka at Swisscom and what is it for?

## Start Kafka
Run Kafka locally by typing:
docker-compose -f kafka.yml up

It contains the presentation and code which I used during Swisscom DevOps week for the talk about Kafka.
The simple examples of setting up Kafka altogether with Spring Boot and Kafka Streams.
